# **AI ADVENTURE BUILDER AND RUNNER**

## **Introduction**
This is a very simple AI adventure builder and runner. It is designed to be used as a teaching tool for students to learn about AI and for the curious to just enjoy and play a game.
The whole magic lies in the initial prompting. We are setting a context that defines how the game should be played.

## **How to play**
1. Enter OpenAI API Key
2. Write an initial starting prompt (Topic, Character, Setting, etc.)
3. Play the game

## **How to run**
1. Clone the repo
2. Install the dependencies
3. Run the app with streamlit. `streamlit run adventure.py`

## **The idea**
The idea came during a birthday party and we started with playing around with chatGPT and elevenlabs to get the story read to you.
